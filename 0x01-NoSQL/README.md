# NoSQL Project

This repository contains scripts and Python functions related to NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB. The project aims to provide an understanding of NoSQL concepts and practical skills in working with MongoDB.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

### General
- What NoSQL means
- The difference between SQL and NoSQL
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Document storage in NoSQL databases
- Types of NoSQL databases
- Benefits of using a NoSQL database
- Querying information from a NoSQL database
- Inserting, updating, and deleting information from a NoSQL database
- Usage of MongoDB

## Requirements
### MongoDB Command File
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.2)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be a comment: `// my comment`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

### Python Scripts
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) and PyMongo (version 3.10)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

### More Info
- Install MongoDB 4.2 in Ubuntu 18.04
- Official installation guide [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
- You can use "container-on-demand" to run MongoDB

## Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of MongoDB and NoSQL databases. Here is an overview of the tasks:

1. List all databases
2. Create a database
3. Insert document
4. List all documents
5. List all documents matching a criteria
6. Count documents
7. Update documents
8. Delete documents
9. List all documents in Python
10. Insert a document in Python
11. Update topics
12. Retrieve schools by topic
13. Log statistics

Each task has specific requirements and scripts to be implemented.
